# Realtime-Face-Recognition
This is project on realtime face recognition. In this project I made use of OpenCV library in python and used the  "LBPHFaceRecognizer"  classifier model provided in the OpenCV library.I trained the model over just 100 images, as it takes large ammount of time to train on large dataset and Large GPU capabilities to train on larger dataset. I stored the training images for the model on my PC in the D:/testimages folder , which consist of two subfolders 0 and 1. folder  0 consist of negative samples and folder 1 consist of positive images(my own face images). So if you want to use this code for your purpose provide the directories name accordingly.
In the repository i provided  My Code written on Jupyter notebook(.ipynb file) , haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file required to extract the face features(its present in the OpenCV library default) and  also my trained model (.yml file).
